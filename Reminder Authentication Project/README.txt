This project is a web application that has the user login to their account to submit a reminder. The login is either through a local process (encryption) or by using a third-party (OAuth). The user can view their
reminder and update it once logged in. I used the classic full-stack methods to create this (HTML, CSS, JS) as well as Node, EJS, Passport, Postgres bCrypt and more.
