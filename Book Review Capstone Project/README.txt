I made this project to practice working with a multitude of subjects: Node, JS, CSS, and most importantly... databases.

This project is a personal book review library. The user (exclusively me) enters the ISBN, title, rating, review, etc, of the book and it will store the information on the server (locally hosted). 
The user can update, delete, and create new entries with the UI. The user can also filter the books by genre and rating. 

I took design inspiration from the Rijksmuseum. I was planning my first solo trip ever to the Netherlands and booked the tour of this museum. It contains a very famous library so it became very fitting to use it as an inspiration.

// RUNNING THE CODE

1. Run "npm i" to install all node packages.
2. Setup the database in PGAdmin.
